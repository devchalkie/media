# Mediable

Package to organise media files and it's customization

# Install

    composer require shortcodes/media
    
# Usage

Model must use trait `Shortcodes/Media/Mediable` and implement `HasMedia` interface

### Register collections

To register collections add method  `registerMediaCollections` and add collections you need 

    public function registerMediaCollections()
    {
        $this->addMediaCollection('avatar')->singleFile();
        $this->addMediaCollection('my-other-collection');
    }

You can define if collection is singular (add `singleFile()` method) or multiple (by default)

### Uploading media files

To be able to upload media files you have to set media routes. You can do that by placing `Route::mediaRoutes();
` in your routes file.

Then you will be able to use it under `POST /media` in basic namespace

In response you will get:

```
"data": {
  "id": 1,
  "name": "example",
  "size": 272605,
  "url": "http://localhost/storage/60/example.jpg"
}
```

> If your disk is not set to public the URL you receive will be proper for chosen disk.

After uploading media it is placed in `MediaLibrary` and can be attach to model

### Attaching single file to model

To attach file to model you need simply to make request (`POST` or `PATCH`) to create or modify model with parameters previously described in `registerMediaCollections` method like in example

    Model::create([...$someArticleAttributes,
        'avatar': 1
    ]);

In `avatar` single collection you need to provide media id received while uploading media.

> While updating model object that already have an avatar and collection is set to `singleFile()` avatar will be replaced 

### Attaching multiple files to model

To attach multiple media files to model you need simply to make request (`POST` or `PATCH`) to create or modify model with parameters previously described in `registerMediaCollections` method like in example

    Model::create([...$someArticleAttributes,
        'my-other-collection': [1,2,3,4]
    ]);

In `my-other-collection` property collection you need to provide array of media ids received while uploading media.

> REMEMBER! While updating model object collection not set to single all skipped media id in array will be deleted. 

### Attaching multiple files to model without removing actual

In case you need to add media file without removing all missing in array you can use `add` key in collection data request

    Model::create([...$someArticleAttributes,
        'my-other-collection': [
            'add' => [1]
        ]
    ]);
    
### Deleting selected files from model

In case you need to remove selected media from object you can use `delete` key in collection data request


    Model::create([...$someArticleAttributes,
        'my-other-collection': [
            'delete' => [3, 4]
        ]
    ]);
